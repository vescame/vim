# Simple ~Plan~ Vim
#### I'm using with vim versions like 8.1 ~ 8.2

has:
- some linter
- some colorscheme
- some git

I plan to add:
- some colorscheme
- some completion
- some support for jenkinsfile, dockerfile, vagrantfile and some other new things

currently has 3 plugins:
- vim-fugitive
- ale
- vim-colors-off (my silly fork where I only removed italic and lightened the comment colouring)
